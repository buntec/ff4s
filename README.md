Check out the [microsite](https://buntec.github.io/ff4s/).

See the `examples` folder for commented code examples.
Try them out by running `examples/fastLinkJS` in sbt and serving
the `index.html` using something like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

For good measure, there is an implementation of [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)
in the `todo-mvc` folder.

Artifacts are published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.buntec" %%% "ff4s" % "<x.y.z>"
```

## A note on literals

By default elements constructed from HTML/SVG strings using `literal` 
are cached for performance. This makes sense for the typical use
case where the number of distinct literals used in an app is bounded.
A good example is SVG icons generated by copy-pasting raw SVG markup from a library.
If for whatever reason your app creates a very large or even unbounded
number of literals (in practice this can only happen if you 
dynamically generate strings at runtime: `literal(s"<div>${iTakeOnArbitrarilyManyValues}</div>")`),
then you can avoid a memory leak by switching off the cache:

```scala
ff4s.IOEntryPoint[State, Action](myApp, cacheLiterals = false)

```
