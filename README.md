Check out the [microsite](https://buntec.github.io/ff4s/).

See the `examples` folder for commented code examples.
Try them out by running `examples/fastLinkJS` in sbt and serving
the `index.html` using something like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

For good measure, there is an implementation of [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)
in the `todo-mvc` folder.

Artifacts are published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.
